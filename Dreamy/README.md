# CREATING A NEW SITE SKIN

In order to create a site skin, you need to have an AO3 account and you need to be logged in.

**How to Install Your Custom AO3 Site Skin**

Follow these steps to customize your Archive of Our Own interface:

**1. Copy the Code**

Head over to the GitHub repository and copy the provided code from **style.css**. You can easily do this by clicking the Copy button located at the top of the code block.

**2. Navigate to Your Skins**  
· Log into your AO3 account.  
· **Tap your username at the top** of the page and select **Dashboard** from the menu.  
· Click on the **Skins** link in the Dashboard sidebar.

**3. Create the New Skin**  
· Click the **Create Site Skin** button.  
· Give a unique name for your skin. _(Tip: To avoid "Title already taken" errors, try adding your username or a specific keyword to the title (e.g., MyCoolSkin_Username)._  
· Paste the CSS code you copied from GitHub into the box labeled CSS.

**4. Save and Activate**  
· Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Submit**. You will be taken to a preview page showing your new skin details.  
· Click the **Use** button. Your new skin is now active and will be visible on any device whenever you are logged in.
